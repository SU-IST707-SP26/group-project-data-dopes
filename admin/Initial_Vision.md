## Initial Vision

### Project: Predicting Loan Deafult Risk: A Data-Driven Approach to Responsible Lending
**Primary Stakeholder:** Financial institutions making loan approval decisions

**Problem Statement:**
Lending institutions need to assess the risk that a loan applicant will default, but traditional decision rules and limited indicators can lead to inconsistent and inaccurate outcomes. This makes it difficult to balance financial risk with fair access to credit.

**Solution:**
We will build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to repay or default using historical loan data. The model will compare a simple baseline approach with more advanced techniques to improve prediction quality, with a focus on metrics appropriate for imbalanced data. The goal is to support more accurate, consistent, and responsible lending decisions.
