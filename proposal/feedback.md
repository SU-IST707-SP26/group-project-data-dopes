This proposal is fine and meets the criteria.  However, I don't think the project as it stands is sufficiently complex for a team of four and the better part of a semester to go.  It is really not a lot more than a week's worth of work.  Much of the complexity here is that you are restricted to the features that are available in the pre-cleaned dataset - there is no way to join this to any other information, so it is basically a hyperparameter tuning problem.  There is no longitudinal information here, and no ability to draw on other data aspects to create more customized predictions.

You might also think a little more deeply about your stakeholder; pick one stakeholder, and think about problem you are trying to solve.  How does your analysis help?  How would it be used?  Is there an opportunity to be *creative* here?  

For example - for a general lender at a mid-size bank... Sure, providing a estimate of default likelihood is nice, but the bank already has it's own models, and they're probably pretty darn good.  But what if the lender wants to support, say, lower income individuals without well-established credit histories?  Or build more creative lending strategies to reduce defaults to help teach people how to be more responsible?  Or intervene *before* a default is likely to happen? These are more creative applications that would drive somewhat different approaches.

So, full points for a good proposal.  However, I will require you to re-submit this proposal with a somewhat more interesting idea by next Weds (2/17).  If you have questions, please reach out.

SCORE: 5/5
