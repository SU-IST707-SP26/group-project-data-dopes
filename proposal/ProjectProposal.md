## Introduction

Lending institutions face an ongoing challenge in deciding which applicants are likely to repay their loans and which may default. These decisions have real financial consequences and can also affect who gains access to credit. Making accurate and consistent lending decisions is therefore important for both managing risk and promoting responsible lending. This project proposes to develop a model that will predict whether a loan applicant is likely to repay their loan or default, using information from past loan outcomes to estimate risk before a loan is approved.

What will make our approach different is the use of a data-driven predictive model that goes beyond simple rules or single measures when evaluating applicants. Instead of relying on one factor at a time, the model will learn from past borrowing behavior and consider how multiple characteristics together relate to loan repayment. By identifying patterns that may not be obvious through manual review, this approach aims to provide a more accurate and consistent way to assess default risk.

If successful, this project could help reduce financial losses caused by loan defaults while improving the overall quality of lending decisions. For lenders, more reliable predictions could support better risk management and long-term financial stability. For borrowers, especially those who may not fit neatly into traditional approval rules, improved decision-making could lead to fairer and more consistent evaluations. Together, these benefits highlight the potential importance of accurate default prediction for creating a lending process that is both financially sound and socially responsible.
